Fobwart is a graphical MUD, with a client-side look-and-feel of
the Megaman series of side-scrolling platform games.

The general design here is very client-heavy, for a few reasons.
One is that in this case, the servers which were available for
our use were not as powerful as the clients in question. A second
was that we wanted to minimize the amount of network activity
while maintaining synchronization. The limitations, which were
acceptable in this case, were that the clients would have to
be trusted, and would have to process events deterministically.
